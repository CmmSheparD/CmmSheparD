# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### `$ whoami`

My name is Gleb Ustinov, and I am yet another CS student on the verge of dropout, and I am interested in applying my skills to creating useful tools and not provoking machine uprising in the process. Here you will find projects that I'm most proud of, aside from some sketches and drafts.

### `$ git clone git@github.com:CmmSheparD/most-interesting.git`

A simple game that plays itself written in **C** with the help of **ncurses**. It's a mess rn, but some day I will tidy it up. What I like in the concept of procedural programming is that it allows to build neat and well-knit little programs, where every module was built for a particular purpose. Low code reusability hits hard though, and I doubt my competence to create something large-scale using this paradigm. But this little thing.. I love it.

***More interesting things are coming soon***

### `$ git clone git@github.com:/CmmSheparD/learning.git`

[![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=CmmSheparD&layout=compact&theme=tokyonight)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

As my first language was **C++** I like low-level programming, but still never miss a chance to try out something different. Here comes my subtle acquaintance with **python**. I'm currently learning **Kotlin/JVM** and, as a consequence, **Java** ~~omg i hate **gradle** so much why is it so messed up~~.

### `$ git checkout terrible-at`

I'm really bad at visual design or even deciding which of two designs would fit better. But I not going to give up and will continue work on this! Completely not interested in front-end development though.
